/** Waits a number of nanoseconds.
 *
 * This function spins the CPU to produce a small delay. It should normally
 * only be used for delays of 10us (10000ns) or less. As it is calculated
 * based on the expected execution time of a software loop, it may well run
 * slower than requested based on activity from other threads and interrupts.
 * If greater precision is required, this can be called from inside a critical
 * section.
 *
 *  @param ns the number of nanoseconds to wait
 *
 *  @note
 *    wait_us() will likely give more precise time than wait_ns for large-enough
 *    delays, as it is based on a timer, but its set-up time may be excessive
 *    for the smallest microsecond counts, at which point wait_ns() is better.
 *
 *  @note
 *    Any delay larger than a millisecond (1000000ns) is liable to cause
 *    overflow in the internal loop calculation. You shouldn't normally be
 *    using this for such large delays anyway in real code, but be aware if
 *    calibrating. Make repeated calls for longer test runs.
 *
 *  @note You may call this function from ISR context.
